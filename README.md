# RestFB (http://restfb.com)
## What it is

RestFB is a pure Java Facebook Graph API client with no external dependencies.

It was created by [Mark Allen](http://revetkn.com) and is maintained by [Norbert Bartels](https://www.phpmonkeys.de/) along with a worldwide team of contributors.

## Licensing

RestFB uses other open-source software - see the `LICENSE.*.txt` files. 
RestFB itself is open source software released under the terms of the MIT License.

RestFB is a single JAR - just drop it into your app and you're ready to go. Download it from Maven Central:

[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.restfb/restfb.svg?label=Latest%20Release&style=for-the-badge)](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.restfb/restfb)

## Building it Yourself

Just type

    mvn package
    
and the jars will be built and can be found in the `target` folder. 

## Usage and examples

We provide well-curated [documentation](https://restfb.com/documentation/) with many code examples. These 
are all clearly commented and give a good overview of the functionality RestFB provides.

Additionally, you can take a look at the integration tests [here](https://github.com/restfb/restfb/tree/master/src/test/java/com/restfb/integration) on GitHub. Some interesting use cases are exercised there and you can get a good idea of the different features that are provided by RestFB.

There is also the [example project](https://github.com/restfb/restfb-examples) on GitHub. It contains a suite of tools that can be triggered via Maven calls. Additionally, for the fetch and publish example, you can find
a JavaFX code sample that shows how an embedded browser is used to fetch a user access token.
