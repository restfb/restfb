## Usage and examples

We provide well-curated [documentation](https://restfb.com/documentation/) with many code examples. These 
are all clearly commented and give a good overview of the functionality RestFB provides.

Additionally, you can take a look at the integration tests [here](https://github.com/restfb/restfb/tree/master/src/test/java/com/restfb/integration) on GitHub. Some interesting use cases are exercised there and you can get a good idea of the different features that are provided by RestFB.

There is also the [example project](https://github.com/restfb/restfb-examples) on GitHub. It contains a suite of tools that can be triggered via Maven calls. Additionally, for the fetching and publishing example, you can find
a JavaFX code sample, that shows how you can use an embedded browser to fetch a user access token.
