# Migration Guide
Because we have a lot of API changes from version 1.x to 2.0 RestFB provides a migration guide, where the breaking changes can be found

## tl;dr
* `Comment.Attachment` -> `StoryAttachment`
* `FacebookClient.executeQuery()` -> `FacebookClient.executeFqlQuery()`
* `FacebookClient.executeMultiquery()` -> `FacebookClient.executeFqlMultiquery()`
* `User.Picture` -> `ProfilePictureSource`
* `Event.getPicture()` return type `String` -> `Event.getPicture()` return type `ProfilePictureSource`
* `Event.getVenue()` return type `Venue` -> returns `Location` now
* `Group.getVenue()` return type `Venue` -> returns `Location` now
* `Checkin.Place` replaced with `Place` type.
* `Post.Place` replaced with `Place` type.
* `Post.Likes` replaced with `Likes` type.
* `Post.Comments` replaced with `Comments` type.
* `Post.Privacy` replaced with `Privacy` type.

## Comment.Attachment removed
We have removed the `Comment.Attachment` type because it is replaced by 
a newer type called `StoryAttachment`. `StoryAttachment` has the same 
fields as `Comment.Attachment` but contains the target field, too. 
Therefore it is better suitable to the original Facebook JSON.

## `FacebookClient#executeQuery` and `FacebookClient#executeMultiquery` removed
The `FacebookClient` interface does not longer provide the `executeQuery` and 
`executeMultiquery` access to FQL. These methods are not longer working on the
Facebook side, so we don't need to support them further.
The `DefaultFacebookClient` does not longer contain these methods. Because some
developer still use the FQL interface (Graph API 2.0) they have to switch to the
newer (and working) `executeFqlQuery` and `executeFqlMultiquery`.

## User.Picture removed
We had to remove the `User.Picture` type because we drop the
compatibility. The picture field is now the `ProfilePictureSource`
type.

## Event.getPicture() returns `ProfilePictureSource` instead of `String`
The `Event.getPicture()` returned the image url as `String`. We changed this because
Facebook provides more information than only a `String`. The `ProfilePictureSource` is
a better choice.

## `Venue` replaced with `Location` type
The `Group` and the `Event` type contain a venue but this is the same type as `Location`.
So we replaced it and don't need to take care of two different java entities.

## deprecated classes removed
We have some types that are only left, because we didn't want the break the API
before version 2.0. With the new major release we can remove them and do some
cleanup. 

* `Checkin.Place` replaced with `Place` type.
* `Post.Place` replaced with `Place` type.
* `Post.Likes` replaced with `Likes` type.
* `Post.Comments` replaced with `Comments` type.
* `Post.Privacy` replaced with `Privacy` type.
