/**
 * Interface for accessing the Facebook Endpoints.
 *
 * Facebook provides several endpoints that are used for working with the Graph API and working with Facebook in
 * general. This interface provides methods to access the different urls.
 *
 * The default implementation is {@link DefaultFacebookEndpoints}. That class provides the access to Facebook and should
 * be used in productive environments.
 *
 * This interface provides some fields with the default URLs so custom implementation can diretly use these or modify
 * the url or provide a completly custom one. This is possible without extending our default implementation.
 *
 * In tests, a custom implementation can be used to mock the Facebook service. The implementing class only needs to
 * provide urls to the mock service and the custom class is set in the {@link DefaultFacebookClient}.
